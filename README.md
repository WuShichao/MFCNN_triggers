## Introduction ##
This repository contains the `MFCNN` GW triggers catalog, for now, we offer O1 GW triggers founded by `MFCNN`, we will add O2 & O3 triggers here in the near future. If leaving the data quality alone, we find 3955 triggers in O1 which include `GW150914`, `GW151012` and `GW151226`. If we consider only the data which pass the `CBC-CAT3` test there are 2305 triggers in O1.
