## Introduction ##
`MFCNN` is our GW Event Trigger Generator (ETG), which is a matched-filtering-aided CNN.

This repository contains the `MFCNN` GW triggers catalog, for now, we offer O1 GW triggers triggered by `MFCNN`, we will add O2 & O3 triggers here in the near future. If leaving the data quality alone, we find 3363 triggers in O1 which include `GW150914`, `GW151012` and `GW151226`. If we consider only the data which pass the `CBC_CAT3` test, there are 2069 triggers in O1.

Here, we only offer the triggers which pass the `CBC_CAT3` test, so totally 2069 triggers in O1 data.


## Analysis Details ##
The details of `MFCNN` and our analysis are available in this [preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13442).


## Accessing the Catalog: mfcnn_catalog_O1.hdf5 ##
There are two groups within the file, `/known_events` and `/complete`. Under each group, you can find a dataset with the same name. The `complete` dataset is the full dataset from our analysis.


```python
import h5py

catalog = h5py.File('./mfcnn_catalog_O1.hdf5', 'r')

# Get a numpy structured array of the candidate event GPS time and duration.
all_candidates = catalog['complete']
bbh_candidates = catalog['known_events']

# Show the GPS time of GW150914, GW151012 & GW151226.
print(bbh_candidates[:,0])
# Show the trigger duration of GW150914, GW151012 & GW151226.
print(bbh_candidates[:,1])

# Just like above, we can show all triggers' GPS time & trigger duration.
print(all_candidates[:,0])
print(all_candidates[:,1])
```

##### File format #####
Both datasets are structured arrays which have the following columns.

| Column           | Description                                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 |     The GPS time of `MFCNN` triggers.                                        |
| 1 |     The GPS time-centric trigger duration (in seconds).                                    |
